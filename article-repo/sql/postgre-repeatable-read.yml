title: PostgreSQL repeatable read isolation and lost update prevention
description: |-
  Default transaction isolation level in Postgres is read committed which doesn't prevent from non-repeatable
  read and lost update anomalies despite the fact that Postgres internally use MVCC. Using repeatable read isolation level 
  could be an alternative of using explicit database locks.
