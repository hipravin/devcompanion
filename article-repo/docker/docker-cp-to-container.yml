title: Docker copy to named volume with mapped container
description: |-
  Given named volume devcompanion_article-repo-volume and container devcompanion_storage_1
  while image devcompanion_storage is created with mapping: article-repo-volume:/usr/local/article-repo:rw.
  After a while separate storage container was removed and article-service container is used instead. 
  Now project build phase doesn't imply persistent volume population.
codeBlocks:
  - title: Copies folder article-repo to /usr/local/article-repo/usr/local/article-repo which means VOLUME/article-repo/... (article-repo folder is created)
    code: |-
      docker cp article-repo devcompanion_storage_1:/usr/local/article-repo/...
      docker cp article-repo devcompanion_article-service_1:/usr/local/article-repo/...
  - title: Copies folder contents of article-repo to /usr/local/article-repo/usr/local/article-repo which means VOLUME/... (article-repo folder is not created)
    code: |-
      docker cp article-repo/. devcompanion_storage_1:/usr/local/article-repo
      docker cp article-repo/. devcompanion_article-service_1:/usr/local/article-repo
  - title: |-
      Creates a dummy container that can be used if existing such as devcompanion_storage_1 isn't available.
      No need to start that container. After copy complete it can be removed.
    code: |-
      docker container create --name dummy -v devcompanion_article-repo-volume:/root hello-world

      Also it's possible to import files using Docker desktop built-in facilities.
    code: |-
      Container -> Files -> [Right click] -> Import
