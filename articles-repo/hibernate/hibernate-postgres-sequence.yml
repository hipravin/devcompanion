title: Java JPA hibernate id column with postgres sequence
description: >
  Id values used by hibernate will start from ${start_value-allocation_size}.
  Thus need to provide start value other than zero to prevent from negative ids.
  allocationSize allows hibernate to create a bunch of new instances without asking database for new id value each time.
  Note that 'increment by' should be equal to allocationSize or at least greater than it.
  Article updated 1000 -> 100. NUMRIC(19,0) -> BIGSERIAL.
